Formerly complicated tasks like audio transcription for videos have become much simpler thanks to the rise of APIs like Google's Speech-to-Text. But while this exciting new tool can handle transcription, if you want to transcribe a lot of audio, your code still needs to set up connections and authentication and pipe the information back and forth. In this course, instructor Fikayo Adepoju shows you how to integrate Node.js applications with Google AI Speech-to-Text. Learn how to set up Google AI Speech-to-Text, build the video transcriber interface, develop the back end and connect to the AI, and then bring it all together.

This course is designed for intermediate and advanced developers interested in the future of development with generative AI and the integration of applications with AI models.


## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
